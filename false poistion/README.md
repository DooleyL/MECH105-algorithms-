this code uses the false postion method to find the root of a given function   
1. inputs,
2. a lower guess and a upper guess
3. stop at desired error of 0.0001%
4. stop after 200 iterations because if not stop is made if the inputs were at say a maximun it would diverge and never stop
5. outputs (this is what the function will display)
6. the root
7. the function evaluated root location
8. the approximant relitive error
9. how many iterations it preformed
